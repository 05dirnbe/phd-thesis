\section*{Acknowledgments}
	
	As I write these first couple of lines intended to thank my advisor Kurt Mehlhorn, I struggle to find the words capturing the depth of my gratitude towards him. Kurt, if you read this, please know that never before did the expression \emph{Doktorvater} mean so much to me and never will I forget the role you played in my life. 

	To me (and to many others) you are, and always will be, a true role model worthy of admiration. You are a just and caring person, a giant of science, an unparalleled teacher, a wise mentor and an exemplary leader. I admire you for your humble demeanor, your perfect diligence and your unwavering purpose. Your down-to-earth attitude and your positive outlook on virtually everything uplifts and inspires everyone around you.

	I am grateful for the privilege of being your student. I feel extremely humbled by your unending support and constant encouragement. I am grateful that you bravely trusted me to find myself through my own projects, even if they were risky and out of the ordinary. At times I struggled at this task, but you never failed to help me find the missing pieces. In truth, your generous advice quietly enabled me every step of the way. I will carry with me the numerous lessons you taught me about science and about life. For this I will always be indebted to you. In fact, I hope to one day, be able to do for someone, what you have done for me.\bigskip
	
	In addition to Kurt, there are many others that deserve my gratitude. Without them this thesis would not have been possible. This is particularly true for my many outstanding co-authors. True to the nature of modern science, most of the results presented in this thesis are the product of various collaborations and many hours of lively discussions amongst colleagues. I would be remiss If I didn't mention Adrian Neumann and Matthias F\"ugger who shared my ideas and supported me actively during the earlier and the later stages of my doctorate respectively. Roughly two thirds of my sanity have probably been preserved by interacting with those two individuals and with my office mates.\bigskip

	The last thank you is dedicated to my better half, Sarah. I know that the completion of this thesis was as hard on my as it was on you. Thank you for being patient and for overlooking the many late-night sessions it required without complaint. Thank you also for always being convinced that my stuff was solid and that I was solid and that I would pull through in the end no matter what.
