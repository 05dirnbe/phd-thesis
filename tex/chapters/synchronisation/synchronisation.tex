\chapter{Modelling Flows}\label{chap:model}

	In this chapter we propose to model the oscillatory flows observed in the vein networks formed by the slime mold \Pp as currents in an electric circuit. Our approach is inspired by the modeling of the human cardiovascular system and relies on electronic elements such as resistors, capacitors and current controlled voltage sources to capture the properties of interacting flow-carrying veins of the organism. In particular we map the effects of oscillatory peristaltic pumping to the behavior of a simple interacting electronic circuit, the so-called \Pe. Connecting these elements according to a given graph, yields an electric \Pn. The currents induced by certain networks exhibit complex emergent flow patterns reminiscent of the flows observed in live \P. Our model is simple, fully distributed and and robust to changes in the topology of the \Pn. Thus it constitutes a promising basis for the future development of distribtuted natural computing algorithms.

	This chapter documents joined work with Prof.~Martin~Grube and Dr.~M.~F\"ugger. The former provided many valuable insights regarding the biology of \P, while the latter was the driving force behind the analytic work presented in this chapter.
