\chapter{Introduction}

In this chapter we give a concise introduction to the basic topics and concepts this thesis is concerned with. We start by familiarizing the reader with the humble yet highly interesting organisms that is the slime mold \Pp. After a short excursion to the realm of biology, we proceed by introducing the highly interdisciplinary field of Natural Computing where we highlight various successful algorithms and the natural phenomena that served as their source of inspiration. After illustrating how one may look to nature to drive the development of new algorithms, we discuss how \P was discovered to be relevant as a medium for Natural Computing. In this context we survey break-through experimental findings as well as the most important Natural Computing approaches realized so far. The chapter closes by giving the motivation of this thesis, namely to pave the way towards novel approaches to Natural Computing with \Pp.
