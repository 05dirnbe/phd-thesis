\chapter{Physarum Polycephalum and Natural Computing}

natural computing lies at the intersection of several fields
relies in particular on models of organism, incorporating facts from biology and physics which are established experimentally
experiments give intuition for modelling
these modes capture the behaviour of some organism which may be exploited to solve well defined computational problems in a unexpected fashion
nature inspired algorithms are no different from other algorithms in that they need to be proven correct and runtime guarantees are desired
at this point the work of the computer scientist is done
one may however ask the question, whether the operation of the algorithms accurately mimicks the operation of the organism
if so, an in-depth understanding of the algorithms may yield insights into the operation of the organism
this is particularily interesting for organisms believed to realize some sort of optimization process
