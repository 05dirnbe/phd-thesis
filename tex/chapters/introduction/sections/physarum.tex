\section{Introduction to Myxomycetes and Physarum Polycephalum}

In this section we give a basic introduction to slime molds (myxomycetes) and \P in particular. We summarize selected material form several sources that provide more detailed surveys~\cite{nowotny2000myxomyceten,grube2016physarum,Sauer1986,Mayne2016,howard1931life}. Our exposition closely follows~\cite{nowotny2000myxomyceten}.
