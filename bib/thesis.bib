 ISSN = {00029122, 15372197},

 abstract = {The life cycle of Physarum polycephalum is initiated at the splitting of the wall of the spore after fifteen to seventy-two hours incubation in a drop of water. At about the time of germination the nucleus of the spore always divides once mitotically. This may be just before the spore wall splits, or just after it splits but before the protoplast emerges, or just after the emergence of the protoplast. Whether the number of cells seen to emerge from the spore is one or two depends upon the place and time of this nuclear and subsequent cell division. After a quiescent period following emergence from the spore case each daughter cell puts out an anterior flagellum and becomes first an amoeboid swarmcell and then changes to a comma-shaped rotating one. Intense illumination and moisture conditions may cause the swarmcell to retract its flagellum and to encyst. When the unfavorable condition is removed the protoplast may emerge from the cyst membrane and again become a flagellated swarmcell. Motile comma-shaped swarmcells function as isogametes which fuse posteriorly in pairs to form zygotes. It is believed that after nuclear fusion and division of the fusion nucleus the plasmodial stage is initiated, although a complete series of steps is lacking. The multiple fusion of swarmcells to form the plasmodium was never observed. The mycophagous extramatrical habit of the plasmodium has facilitated its study. Bacteria when abundant are detrimental to the plasmodium and may bring about its disintegration. The plasmodium may be slowly dried and the resulting sclerotium later reactivated at any time up to at least eight months by placing it under moist aerobic conditions. The plasmodial strands have a differentiated cortical layer and a highly reticulate protoplasmic structure. In the plasmodium, nuclei have been found only in the resting condition. The plasmodium becomes transformed into sporangia only at night. The transition from a plasmodium to mature sporangia requires about twelve hours under favorable conditions. The change of the open plasmodium to a continuous verrucose layer, subsequent segmentation of this layer and formation of knobs, followed by vertical pillars and a successively dichotomously lobing sporangial head have been followed in detail. Stipe formation proceeds in a definite manner. The structure of the protoplasm changes from reticulate to homogeneous in the sporangial head. Capillitium formation is by secretion and not by protoplasmic disintegration and it is completed before mitotic division. The capillitium is at first badhamoid and then becomes differentiated into lime-filled nodes and limeless internodes. Nuclei of two types may be distinguished: larger, lightly stained ones which undergo mitotic division, and smaller, densely stained ones which disintegrate. Cytokinesis occurs concurrently with the mitotic nuclear division preceding spore formation. Apparently only a single nuclear division requiring about thirty minutes for completion takes place. Paired nuclei suggesting a second division have not been observed. Following final cleavage of the protoplasm into uniformly hexagonal, uninucleate masses, a continuous intersporal membrane is formed in the furrows. This splits longitudinally to form the spore walls. After splitting, the walls pull apart and the spores become spherical. During this pulling apart, irregularities become visible on the adjoining surfaces which develop into the minute spinules on the mature spore wall.},

abstract ={Interest in the structure and function of physical biological networks has spurred the development of a number of theoretical models that predict optimal network structures across a broad array of taxonomic groups, from mammals to plants. In many cases, direct tests of predicted network structure are impossible given the lack of suitable empirical methods to quantify physical network geometry with sufficient scope and resolution. There is a long history of empirical methods to quantify the network structure of plants, from roots, to xylem networks in shoots and within leaves. However, with few exceptions, current methods emphasize the analysis of portions of, rather than entire networks. Here, we introduce the Leaf Extraction and Analysis Framework Graphical User Interface (LEAF GUI), a user-assisted software tool that facilitates improved empirical understanding of leaf network structure. LEAF GUI takes images of leaves where veins have been enhanced relative to the background, and following a series of interactive thresholding and cleaning steps, returns a suite of statistics and information on the structure of leaf venation networks and areoles. Metrics include the dimensions, position, and connectivity of all network veins, and the dimensions, shape, and position of the areoles they surround. Available for free download, the LEAF GUI software promises to facilitate improved understanding of the adaptive and ecological significance of leaf vein network structure.},

abstract = "Any artificial concurrent computing system involves a potential risk of “deadlock” that its multiple processes sharing common computational resources are stuck in starved conditions, if simultaneous accesses of the processes to the resources were unconditionally permitted. To avoid the deadlock, it is necessary to set up some form of central control protocol capable of appropriately regulating the resource allocation. On the other hand, many decentralized biological systems also perform concurrent computing based on interactions of components sharing limited amounts of available resources. Despite the absence of a central control unit, they appear to be free from the deadlock implying their death, as long as they are alive. Should we consider that biological computing paradigms are essentially different from artificial ones? Here we employ a photosensitive amoeboid cell known as a model organism for studying cellular information processing and construct an experimental system to explore how the amoeba copes with deadlock-like situations induced by optical feedback control. The feedback control is implemented by a recurrent neural network algorithm for leading the amoeba to solve a particular constraint satisfaction problem. We show that the amoeba is capable of breaking through the deadlock-like situations because its oscillating cellular membrane spontaneously produces a wide variety of spatiotemporal patterns. The result implies that our system can be developed to a neurocomputer that works as logical circuit, associative memory device, combinatorial optimization problem solver, and chaotic computer capable of spontaneous transition among multiple solutions.

abstract="We demonstrate a neurocomputing system incorporating an amoeboid unicellular organism, the true slime mold Physarum, known to exhibit rich spatiotemporal oscillatory behavior and sophisticated computational capabilities. Introducing optical feedback applied according to a recurrent neural network model, we induce that the amoeba's photosensitive branches grow or degenerate in a network-patterned chamber in search of an optimal solution to the traveling salesman problem (TSP), where the solution corresponds to the amoeba's stably relaxed configuration (shape), in which its body area is maximized while the risk of being illuminated is minimized.Our system is capable of reaching the optimal solution of the four-city TSP with a high probability. Moreover, our system can find more than one solution, because the amoeba can coordinate its branches' oscillatory movements to perform transitional behavior among multiple stable configurations by spontaneously switching between the stabilizing and destabilizing modes. We show that the optimization capability is attributable to the amoeba's fluctuating oscillatory movements. Applying several surrogate data analyses, we present results suggesting that the amoeba can be characterized as a set of coupled chaotic oscillators.",

Robust network performance involves a complex trade-off involving cost, transport efficiency, and fault tolerance. Biological networks have been honed by many cycles of evolutionary selection pressure and are likely to yield reasonable solutions to such combinatorial optimization problems. Furthermore, they develop without centralized control and may represent a readily scalable solution for growing networks in general. We show that the slime mold Physarum polycephalum forms networks with comparable efficiency, fault tolerance, and cost to those of real-world infrastructure networks{\textemdash}in this case, the Tokyo rail system.

abstract="Physarum polycephalum, a true slime mould, is a primitive, unicellular organism that creates networks to transport nutrients while foraging. The design of these natural networks proved to be advanced, e.g. the slime mould was able to find the shortest path through a maze. The underlying principles of this design have been mathematically modelled in literature. As in real life the slime mould can design fault tolerant networks, its principles can be applied to the design of man-made networks. In this paper, an existing model and algorithm are adapted and extended with stimulation and migration mechanisms which encourage formation of alternative paths, optimize edge positioning and allow for automated design. The extended model can then be used to better design fault tolerant networks. The extended algorithm is applied to several national and international network configurations. Results show that the extensions allow the model to capture the fault tolerance requirements more accurately. The resulting extended algorithm overcomes weaknesses in geometric graph design and can be used to design fault tolerant networks such as telecommunication networks with varying fault tolerance requirements.",

A flexible and multi-task architecture brings new possibilities to work with complex data sets and produce valuable visual results. We present several key features of Gephi in the context of interactive exploration and interpretation of networks. It provides easy and broad access to network data and allows for spatializing, filtering, navigating, manipulating and clustering. Finally, by presenting dynamic features of Gephi, we highlight key aspects of dynamic network visualization.},

pages = {236-245},
year = {2011},
doi = {10.1104/pp.110.162834},
abstract ={Interest in the structure and function of physical biological networks has spurred the development of a number of theoretical models that predict optimal network structures across a broad array of taxonomic groups, from mammals to plants. In many cases, direct tests of predicted network structure are impossible given the lack of suitable empirical methods to quantify physical network geometry with sufficient scope and resolution. There is a long history of empirical methods to quantify the network structure of plants, from roots, to xylem networks in shoots and within leaves. However, with few exceptions, current methods emphasize the analysis of portions of, rather than entire networks. Here, we introduce the Leaf Extraction and Analysis Framework Graphical User Interface (LEAF GUI), a user-assisted software tool that facilitates improved empirical understanding of leaf network structure. LEAF GUI takes images of leaves where veins have been enhanced relative to the background, and following a series of interactive thresholding and cleaning steps, returns a suite of statistics and information on the structure of leaf venation networks and areoles. Metrics include the dimensions, position, and connectivity of all network veins, and the dimensions, shape, and position of the areoles they surround. Available for free download, the LEAF GUI software promises to facilitate improved understanding of the adaptive and ecological significance of leaf vein network structure.},
